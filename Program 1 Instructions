**Program 1 Instructions and Pseudocode**

This program cleans the raw behavioural data, and interpolates behavioural data at the Ca imaging times. It does so for a single session. 

The input is the behavioural data for the session (.xslx file output by Ethnovision) and the raw Calcium imaging data for all sessions from a mouse (.csv file output by Inscopix Data Processing Software)

**Instructions**
1. Insert the row numbers of the start of the session and end of the session in Ca imaging data in cell 3
2. Insert your file pathways and names for the behavioural data file and Ca imaging file in cell 4
3. Insert your output file pathway and filename in cell 4
4. Run the program


**Pseudocode**
1. Read in behavioural data for the session
2. Clean behavioural dta by replacing missing values with a zero
3. Read in Ca imaging data for the session and reindex
4. Determine the start and end times of the Ca imaging data
5. If necessary, delete Ca imaging data for end of session so that it lies within the behavioural data time range
6. Interpolate grid positions, speeds and locations at Ca imaging data times from behavioural data
7. Calculate speeds at Ca imaging times from interpolated position data
8. Combine Ca imaging data and interpolated behavioural data into a single dataframe
9. Write combined dataframe to output file
