**Program 3 Instructions and Pseudocode**

This program takes as input the combined Ca imaging and interpolated behavioural data, and the place cell identifications, determines the total per-session activity for each cell. It creates a combined table of the total activity and the place cell identification. 

**Instructions**
1. Insert the locations of the input files and the output file in cell 2
2. Insert the Mouse ID in cell 2
3. Define variables in cell 3. These include: whether or not pruning is applied and the thresholds for pruning (set to on); whether or not the pruning is average speed based (set to off); the time between Ca imaging samples (set to 0.049962). See program 2 instructions for further details.
4. Run the program

**Pseudocode**
1. Read in the combined Ca imaging and interpolated behavioural data for all sessions for the mouse
2. Drop unecessary columns and rename columns
3. Prune data and remove unecessary columns
4. Count cell activations for cell cell in each session
5. Read in place cell identification data
6. Combine place cell identification data and cell activation count into a single dataframe
7. Write combined dataframe to the output file
