**Program 6 Instructions and Pseudocode**

This program takes as input the Gaussian filtered ratemaps all sessions for a mouse, and determines the correlations of the population vectors for the mice, and the mean correlations between population vectors. The same is determined for sets of shuffled data, and a value to beat for significance determined.

**Instructions**
1. Insert the locations of the output file in cell 2
2. Define variables in cell 3. The variables are the number of shuffles to be performed and the grid size.
3. Insert the file locations and names for the Gaussian filtered ratmaps in cells 4-7
4. Run the program

**Pseudocode**
1. Read in Gaussian filtered ratemaps for all sessions for the mouse
2. Calculate the mean population vector correlation between sessions 1 and 3, and 2 and 4. 
3. Calculate the mean population vector correlation between sessions 1 and 3, and 2 and 4 for the data shuffles. 
4. Determine, from the shuffled data, the values to beat for significance
5. Write the results of step (2) and (4) to a file
