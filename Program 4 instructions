**Program 4 Instructions and Pseudocode**

This program takes as input the combined Ca imaging and interpolated behavioural data for all sessions for a mouse, and determines raw and Gaussian filtered ratemaps for the cell activities. 

There are two versions of this program: one for mice with four sessions of data; and one for mice with six sessions of data.  

**Instructions**
1. Insert the locations of the input files and the output file in cell 2
2. Define variables in cell 3. These include: the standard deviation of teh Gaussian filter (set to 2 bins); whether or not pruning is applied and the thresholds for pruning (set to on); whether or not the pruning is average speed based (set to off); See program 2 instructions for further details.
4. Run the program

**Pseudocode**
For each session:
1. Read in the combined Ca imaging and interpolated behavioural data for the session
2. Apply pruning
3. Determine bin occupancy and occupancy probabilities
4. Calculate cell activations per bin for each cell
5. Calculate the raw ratemap for each cell by dividing activations per bin by the occupancy time
6. Write raw ratemaps to a file
7. Apply Gaussian filtering to raw ratemaps
8. Write Gaussian filtered ratemaps to file
