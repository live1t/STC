**Program 5 Instructions and Pseudocode**

This program takes as input the Gaussian filtered ratemaps all sessions for a mouse, and determines the correlations of the ratemaps between sessions 1 and 3, and sessions 2 and 4. It also plots activity maps for one cell. 

There are two versions of this program: one for mice with four sessions of data; and one for mice with six sessions of data.  

**Instructions**
1. Insert the locations of the input files and the output file in cell 3
2. Define variables in cell 3. Most of these are unecessary, other than Grid size.
3. Define the cell to be plotted in cell 10
4. Run the program

**Pseudocode**
1. Read in Gaussian filtered ratemaps for all sessions for the mouse
2. Calculate correlatons between: (i) session 1 and session 3; and (ii) session 2 and session 4
3. Write correlations to ouput file
4. Plot ratemaps for defined cell
