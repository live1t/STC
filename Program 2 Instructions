**Program 2 Instructions and Pseudocode**

This program identifies place cells for a mouse based on a spatial information calculation and comparison to shuffled data. 

The input is the combined Ca imaging and interpolated behavioural data for all sessions for a given mouse output by program one.

**Instructions**
1. Insert your file pathways and names for the combined Ca imaging and behavioural data for each session in cell 3
2. Insert your output file pathway and filename in cell 3
3. Define variables in cell 4. These are: the number of shuffles to be performed (set at 2000); the gridsize (set at 16 by 16); the time between each Ca imaging sample (set at XXXX); whether data pruning is applied (set to 1, i.e., pruning is applied); whether average speed-based pruning is applied (set to 0, i.e., not applied); defining a spike threshold for counting events in the Ca imaging data (set to 5); what the threshold speed is for determining exploration (set to 0); the threshld for identifying place cells, i.e., the top % that the real spatial information needs to be in (set to top 1%).
4. Run the program


**Pseudocode**
For each session:
1. Read in combined Ca imagining and interpolated behavioural data for the session
2. Apply data pruning to remove small Ca imaging spikes (as defined by the threshold)
3. Determining occupancy times per bin of the grid for the session
4. Determine number of cell activations per bin of the grid for the session
5. Determine real spatial informations for each cell
6. Determined shuffled spatial informations for each cell
7. Compare the shuffled spatial information to the real spatial information to identify place cells
9. Write place cell identification to file
